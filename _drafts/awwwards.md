title: Awwwards sites of the day
---

Awwwards is a long running showcase site that, in their own words, "recognize the talent and effort of the best web designers, developers and agencies in the world." Primarily design focused Awwwards doesn't place much stock in performance when selecting their sites of the day. We decided to evaluate the performance of five recent winners in the Web Agencies category.

## Statistics

We decided to just look at the mobile PageSpeed scores of the home page for each site. Here are the results:

- [We Like Small](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.welikesmall.com%2F): 71/100
- [Elastique](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elastique.de%2Fwork%2F): 67/100
