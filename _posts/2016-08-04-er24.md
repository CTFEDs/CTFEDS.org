## Review

Unfortunately there's not a lot to love about the ER24 site. The site is big in every metric that you care to pick. Looking at the home page:

* there 1650 lines of HTML;
* a bit of a class of classitis, especially on the menus, of which there are a lot;
* there are 162 requests: about 60 CSS files and 70 JavaScript files;
* the site is about 3MB.

There's no quick fix, unfortunately. The best thing to do would be a massive content audit and content strategy review. That would result in less stuff on the page. That would fewer lines of code, and give the possibility of removing  lots of the CSS and JS files (by removing the WordPress plugins, because the "feature" isn't needed any more).

It's a bit of a clanger.
