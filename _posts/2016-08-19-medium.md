[Medium.com](https://medium.com/) is a reading and writing platform, sort of like a hosted blog service with lots of community stuff built in. It tries to encourage slightly longer-form writing and more considered commenting. It's become popular because it looks good to read and it's writing interface is pretty friendly.

## Statistics

* [Google's PageSpeedInsight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F): 59 / 100 on mobile and 85 / 100 on desktop.
* [WebPageTest on 3G](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/160817_MC_a7da27427bbbeca2658b104e0d58596f/): SpeedIndex 6575 on first view and 3967 on repeat view.

## Review

- The low Page Speed score is overall pretty fair, but it seems little cheeky to penalise them for the short cache time on `https://ssl.google-analytics.com/ga.js`.
- The optimisation of images is particularly important. The initial page load is about 1MB. As you scroll down the page, images lazy load in at about 200 or 300KB each. Combine this with the infinite scrolling and you can get a very heavy page very quickly (I got to 12MB before I decided to stop). Goodbye data plan!
- [7 seconds for the first view](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=160817_MC_a7da27427bbbeca2658b104e0d58596f-r:1-c:0) (for some lightly styled text) seems a bit long. And that's broadly true of the site as a while: it has a simple, beautiful, minimal design, but in terms of FED performance is heavy for it. [Half the weight of the page is JS](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/160817_MC_a7da27427bbbeca2658b104e0d58596f/1/breakdown/), which again is a bit odd for a text and pictures page.

It's not clear without some digging what all the JS is for: probably for the writing side of things. If a bunch of that could only be loaded when it's needed (it's already loaded async, which is great), that would make the page smaller and faster.

Optimising the images further would also reduce the page weight and therefore the data cost to the user. It might be a good idea to switch from infinite scroll to paging. This would put a cap in the weight of a particular page.
