Takealot is a popular South African ecommerce site. They stock a wide range of goods, so they have big Information Architecture challenges. They process of a lot of transactions, so they have big scaling challenges. We're going to focus on something that we can see and test: the front-end performance of the site.

## Statistics

* Google's PageSpeedInsight: [53 on mobile and, erm, 5 (!) on desktop](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.takealot.com%2F&tab=mobile)
* Webaim's WAVE: [1 error and 115 alerts](http://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://www.takealot.com/)
* WebPageTest on 3G, running Motorola G, Chrome: [SpeedIndex of 19294 on first view](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160605_HJ_f56acba8e102bb1422cf9edaf1a7d13f/)

## Review

Here are a few things that stand out as areas for improvement:

- lots of static assets could be cached;
- lots of images could be optimised;
- lots of JavaScript files.

**Setting expiry date or maximum age headers** for more of the image, CSS, and JS files would mean files get cached by the browser: instead of fetching those files from the web every time, the browser would use the local ones. That means **the page would load faster and use less of the user's data**.

**Optimising the images** would reduce the file sizes. **That means the page would load faster and use less of the user's data**.

**Combining / concatenating the JavaScript files** would lead to fewer HTTP requests, meaning a **faster page load**. Ideally, **the number of JavaScript files should be reduced**. There are quite a lot of scripts that add glitzy UI elements (tooltips, scroll-jacking, and the like): it would be worth **reviewing these with user testing** to see whether they add real value to users. There are also quite a few `script` tags inside the page itself: these should be moved to external files so that they can be cached, and more maintainable.
