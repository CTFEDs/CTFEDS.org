[Open Design Cape Town](http://opendesignct.com/) runs from 12 to 23 August 2015 at City Hall. This year, the theme is **Design is for Tomorrow**.

We'll be running a CTFEDs event (instead of [our regular meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/)) as part of the festival: **a hands-on workshop** for making your site even better. Bring along your laptop and a site or two that you're working on. We'll also have two lightning talks: one on SVGs and one on jQuery vs regular JavaScript.

**Date**: TBC, but either Saturday 15th August or Saturday 22nd.
**Time**: 10 am to 3pm, with a lunch break from 12pm to 1pm.

## Design is for Tomorrow

What does **Design is for Tomorrow** mean to Front-end developers? To us, it means thinking and behaving in a [Future Friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/) way ([local version](http://www.futurefriendly.co.za/)): acknowledge and embrace unpredictability, and make your websites with that in mind. We'll run through some practical steps for making it more Future Friendly.

Here are [the principles that we'll be following](open-design-2015-principles.html), and [the checklist we'll be using](open-design-2015-checklist.html).
