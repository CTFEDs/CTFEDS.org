## Principles

For Front-end developers, **Design is for Tomorrow** means embracing two "big ideas": being [Future Friendly](#future-friendly), and using [Progressive Enhancement](#progressive-enhancement).

### Future Friendly

[Future Friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/) is a way of thinking that admits that we don't know what's coming next. It's about broad design principles and future-friendly values rather specific techniques.

> The quantity and diversity of connected devices - many of which we haven't imagined yet - will explode, as will the quantity and diversity of the people around the world who use them.

It's about choosing to:

* Acknowledge and embrace unpredictability;
* Think and behave in a future-friendly way;
* Help others do the same.

 It's about adopting a user-centered approach, and keeping a sharp focus on meaningful content and services.


### Progressive Enhancement

Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development that aims to deliver the best possible experience to the widest possible audience, by putting the user first. It splits web pages clearly into three bits:

* HTML for structured content;
* CSS for presentation;
* JavaScript for behaviour.
