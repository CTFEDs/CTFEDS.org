## About the talk: Starting a new project with AngularJS

We’ve been using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) in [SnapScan](http://www.snapscan.co.za/) since the start, and we’ve grown quite fond of it. I’ll be talking about why you should consider Angular for your next project, and what the pitfalls are you might encounter along the way.

Estiaan is a entrepreneur, front-end developer and UX guy. Once he was also a game designer. He studied engineering at Stellenbosch before completing his masters at the MIH Media Lab on interfacing in mixed reality environments. He’s been involved in start-ups and incubators since his post-grad days, and decided to help out a few friends with a new idea called [SnapScan](http://www.snapscan.co.za/) in the beginning of 2013 - where he’s been ever since.  These days he runs product and development, but he still loves tweaking the user interface when no one’s looking.

## About the talk: Performa...nce

No one likes waiting for pages to load and slow websites are bad for business. I'll show you some of the research on how performance can impact a business's bottom line and hopefully convince you in the process. I'll teach you what you should know as a front-end developer to get your pages loading and rendering as quickly as possible and I'll briefly touch on some of the backend concepts that also come into play. I'll end after getting the page rendered that first time, so this won't touch on things like animation and scrolling performance.
