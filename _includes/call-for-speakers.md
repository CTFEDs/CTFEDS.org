## Diversity

The CTFEDs organising team wants people of any gender, ethnicity, orientation, ability, experience, or financial status to feel welcome, safe, and confident to attend our events. We want our community to be more diverse, inclusive, and representative because we believe that a diverse and inclusive community benefits everyone. We want our community members to approach each other with empathy, understanding, mutual respect, tolerance.

We’re working to get better: we know that we’re at the start of journey and that we’ll fail a lot of times. We hope that you will help us on journey, [tell us when we misstep](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders), and help us get back on the right path.

## Help!

We would love to help you and offer guidance on putting together a talk (or a workshop). We’ll be with you every step of the way that you’d like help with, on the iterative feedback process. We’ll help by being an appreciative and supportive audience that will provide constructive feedback to help you get ready.

Want to talk something through? [Contact us](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders) and we’ll find time for a chat on the phone, Skype, or Hangouts. We're happy to answer any questions you have.

The [CTFEDs organising team](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders) are experienced speakers and workshop runners and will help you throughout the iterative feedback steps of preparing.

* **Deciding on a theme.** What are you interested in? What do you want to find out more about?
* **Thinking of the elevator pitch.** What makes an in interesting story?
* **Putting together an outline.** Bullet points FTW! What's the one main point you want to get across, and how do you start and end?
* **Making slides.** Making your own, or [using a template](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides).
* **Practising the talk or discussing the workshop content** We’ll be an appreciative and supportive audience that will provide constructive feedback.

## “But I’m a newbie!”

We welcome people from all experience and knowledge levels!

If you’re new to speaking, we are [happy to help](#help). If you already know about a topic are passionate about it, we’ll help you put together a talk or workshop on your favourite front-end thing. Speaking can be scary at first, but it’s very rewarding to share your knowledge.

If you’re new to front-end, we want to hear from you! You can help show other people like you that it’s not as scary and confusing as it looks: everyone has to start somewhere. If you’ve just learned something you are the best person to tell others about it: you know the things to look out for, and what’s unexpected. Giving a talk about a topic is a great excuse to dig into learning about it.

## Topics and timing

We want to hear about all things front-end and related, and are happy to chat through ideas with you. Here are some topics that we’re looking for speakers on.

* Images, the `picture` element, `srcset`.
* schema.org and metadata.
* Lightning talks on CSS things you’ve learned and things you’ve used.
* Responsive workflow.
* Front-end performance.
* Progressive Enhancement.
* Atomic design.

Talks are usually about 30 minutes with some time for questions at the end. If you'd like to do something a bit shorter or a bit longer, let us know.

[Get in touch](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders) and tell us about the story you'd like to share.
