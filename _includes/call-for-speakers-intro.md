We need your help! We’re looking for people like you to share their stories about front-end development and related topics. Yes, **you**!

We’re committed to increasing the diversity of our speaker line-up. We have a [Code of Conduct](http://ctfeds.org/code-of-conduct/) that’s attached to every event we run. We’ll [help you plan and make](#help) your talk or workshop. We welcome [first time speakers, and people who are just getting started on their journey in front-end land](#but-im-a-newbie). If you’re not sure what you’d like to speak about [we can help, or suggest some topics](#topics).

[CTFEDs events](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/) are sometimes talks and sometimes workshops. Talks are usually about 40 minutes long, plus some time for questions after the talk. They’re usually on the first Wednesday of a month at somewhere in or near the centre of Cape Town, with the talk starting at 7pm. Workshops are usually 3 or 4 hours long. They’re usually on a Saturday morning, starting at 10am.
