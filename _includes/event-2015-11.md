## Service Workers

A proper offline experience and the lack of flexible cache control has always meant that the web (especially the mobile web) could never offer the experience a native app does. Service worker changes this for the web. A rich, developer controlled, offline experience is now possible. Service worker was born to tackle offline and bad network conditions for mobile web users. In this talk we will explore what the SW is, what it offers, and how it can be implemented today.

## Push Notifications

As developers and/or product owners we have a channels to engage ours users which all have their pros/cons but are all predominantly pull-based. If you wanted to change this model of interaction a mobile app was the only way out, that or some awkward external service. Since Chrome v46 this has changed and with Service Workers we can now send notifications to devices running the browser, meaning no more native apps!

Being a standard (currently in draft) we are going to be seeing more and more of this feature in the coming months as other browsers start to support it as well, making this a great a option to engage users and keep them coming back without having to install an app.

In this talk we'll have a quick look at the current channels we use to engage, introduce push notifications from the web, show a demo and finally demonstrate how to add it to your own site (app!).
