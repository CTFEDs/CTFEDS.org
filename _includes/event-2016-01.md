## What is the what

We're starting 2016 with something a bit different, and a bit odd. Yes, it will involve pens and sticky notes. :)

We're going to run a **[Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) style meetup to discuss what you (yes, you!) want the CTFEDs group to do this year**. What topics do you want to hear about? Are talks still good, or do you want more discussion, more workshops? Do you want to speak, or know someone you think would be great?

## The set up

Here's how it will work. (We'll provided pens and sticky notes.)

• We'll split into groups of about **four people**.

• Each group will set up three columns: **To Discuss, Discussing, Discussed**.

• We'll **write lots of stickies** for the To Discuss column. Then we'll **talk through the stickies** as a group.

• Next, we'll **vote for the ones we want to discuss**. Each person has **two dot votes**. Use them wisely!

## The end up

To close the session, everyone will be invited to put up a bit of A4 paper with **their name and a To Do for themselves**. It can be something small like "bring a friend to a meetup", or something big like "help run a workshop." The CTFEDs organising team will help you with your To Do!

If you see someone else's To Do that you'd like to help with, **scribble your contact details on their paper**.

You don't have to put something up, but it would be very awesome if you do. :)
