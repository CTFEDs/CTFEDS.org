## Hashtag burgergate.

This talk is about the hamburger icon: it's bad and we can do better. Steve will be talking about the mystery meat of mobile navigation, why burgers are bad for our users, and what we can do to fix it. There will be a lot of meat metaphors, some terrible stock photography, and at least one picture of Steve looking ridiculous.

### Steve Barnett

![Steve Barnett](/assets/img/steve.jpg)

Steve is a Londoner who escaped to Cape Town in 2004. He has a background in maths and finance, but these days he works as a code mentor at [Project codeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/), and as a freelance Front-end developer and User Experience person. He’s a bit addicted to meetups: you can find him helping out with [RailsBridge Cape Town](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/), [Cape Town Front-End Developers (this!)](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/), [SPIN](http://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-SPIN/), and [Mozilla Webmaker](https://stevebarnett.makes.org/thimble/MjAyMDg2ODYwOA==/webmaker-event) events. If he’s not there, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, [taking pictures of it](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maximilianbarners/).

You can find him on Twitter as [@maxbarners](https://twitter.com/maxbarners), on GitHub as [SteveBarnett](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/), and on [his own site Naga](http://naga.co.za/) (which really, really, needs updating) as, erm, himself.

### Note the different venue for this one!

As you enter [Black River Park](http://www.blackriverpark.co.za/) you will see the stairs to the entrance. Remember those :)
The visitors bays are through the booms to the right as you enter.
Once you have parked return to the stairs and enter the complex courtyard. You will see a lift on the far side of the courtyard.
Take that to the second floor and [New Media Labs](http://newmedialabs.com/) is directly opposite the lift as you exit. Ring the buzzer.
Remember to bring your parking ticket so we can stamp it.
