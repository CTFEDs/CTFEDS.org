## About the workshop

This month at CTFEDs we’re going to focus on the bottom building block of everything we do: HTML. In particular, we’re going to focus on accessibility, just in time for [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/).

## About the Global Accessibility Awareness Day

The purpose of GAAD is to get people talking, thinking and learning about digital (web, software, mobile, etc.) accessibility and users with different disabilities.

The target audience of Global Accessibility Awareness Day is the design, development, usability, and related communities who build, shape, fund and influence technology and its use. While people may be interested in the topic of making technology accessible and usable by persons with disabilities, the reality is that they often do not know how or where to start. Awareness comes first.

## Your stuff

For the first half of the workshop we’re going to look at making our own stuff more accessible. We’ll work through some practical examples and then apply the ideas to our own projects. That means things like:

* making sure all images have alt tags;
* using the new stuctural HTML5 elements like section, article, header, footer, and nav;
* using ARIA roles to help guide users through a page, and more.

## Other people’s stuff

For the second half of the workshop we’re going to discuss helping our friends and colleagues learn about accessibility and understand why it’s important. We’ll put together some ideas for what we can all do at our places of work on GAAD, based on the [GAAD participation activities](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/participate.html). That means things like:

* going mouseless for an hour;
* enlarging our default browser font size;
* checking for sufficient colour contrast.

We’ll also talk about how to convince people to take part in these activities!

## About the facilitators

![](assets/img/justin.jpg)

**Justin Slack** is head of design, user experience, and front-end development at [New Media Labs](http://newmedialabs.co.za/). He is fluent in HTML and CSS, and slightly obsessive about typography, web standards, and user experience.

**Steve Barnett** works as a code mentor at [Project codeX](http://www.projectcodex.co/), and as a freelance Front-end developer and User Experience person. He’s a bit addicted to meetups: you can find him helping out with [RailsBridge Cape Town](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/), [Cape Town Front-End Developers](http://ctfeds.org/) (this!), and Mozilla Webmaker events. If he’s not there, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, [taking pictures of it](https://www.flickr.com/photos/maximilianbarners/).

You can find him on Twitter as [@maxbarners](https://twitter.com/maxbarners), on GitHub as [SteveBarnett](https://github.com/SteveBarnett/), and on [his own site Naga](http://naga.co.za/) (which really, really, needs a redesign) as, erm, himself.

## About the (different) RSVPs

There are only 20 spaces available for this workshop, so we’re doing special RSVPs again.

Short version: you’ll need to confirm your attendance one week before the workshop.

Longer version: when you RSVP here you’ll be added to the Waiting List. One week before the workshop we’ll contact you via meetup, asking for confirmation of your attendance. When you reply to this message, we’ll update your RSVP to Yes. If you don’t reply to this message, you won’t be able to attend the workshop. Eep!
