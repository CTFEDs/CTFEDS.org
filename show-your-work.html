        <p>What are you working on? What's something interesting you've just learned? We want to hear from you. Yes, <strong>you!</strong> You don't have to give a long talk or run a workshop to share your knowledge and help other people learn something new. A 5 minute lightning talk will do!</p>

        <p>Here's a handy template to <strong>Show Your Work</strong> to friends, family, and some <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/">Cape Town Front-end Developers</a>. :)</p>

        <h2>1: Elevator Pitch</h2>

        <p><strong>Say why this is interesting</strong>, in one sentence.</p>

        <p>What's the takeaway for people listening? What problem does it solve, or what thing can they learn?</p>

        <p>If you can't say it in one sentence, stop and think for a moment. Are you trying to cover too much? Just cover one thing, or one piece of a big thing, in some detail. Are you not sure what to say? Tell us about how it saved you time, made something easier, or was something new to you.</p>

        <p>One way of think about it in terms of size is: would you expect to find this as an answer to a question you have, maybe on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>?</p>

        <h2>2: Short demo</h2>

        <p><strong>Show us this thing in action.</strong></p>

        <p>You don't have to do live coding: that can be quite nerve-wracking, and things can sometimes go a bit wrong (just like in day-to-day life!). Show us:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A demo of the finished thing. Host it on the web somewhere that other people can access. You could try <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a>, or <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>.</li>
          <li>The source code. You might want to add comments to your code as reminders for yourself and for us to read later.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Have a look at how a Front-end style guide <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/#examples">like Twitter Bootstrap shows their work with their alerts</a>: explanation, example, code sample.</p>

        <h2>3: Credit where it's due</h2>

        <p><strong>Tell us how and where you found out about this.</strong></p>

        <p>One of the best things about our industry is the amount and awesomeness of the resources available. Did you find out about this thing on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Mag</a>, or <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a>? On Twitter from <a href="https://twitter.com/anna_debenham">Anna Debenham</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan">Sara Soueidan</a>? Let us know so we can find more cool stuff too.</p>

        <h2>Get in touch!</h2>

        <p>Ready to lightning talk? <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders">Let us know!</a></p>

        <hr />

        <p>Our turn for credit where it's due: the name of this and the push to get it going (again) came from reading <a href="https://twitter.com/austinkleon">Austin Kleon</a>'s book <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a>. :)</p>
