    <h1 class="block-header">Call for speakers</h1>

    <p>We're always looking for speakers, and we'd love to have you (yes, <strong>you</strong>!) come and talk about something you've learned, or something you think is cool.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You do not have to be an experienced speaker. We're happy to help in any way needed, like planning the content of the talk or doing a dry run.</li>
      <li>We tend to do <strong>talks</strong>, but if you'd like to do a panel or workshop, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/members/?op=leaders">let us know</a>!</li>
      <li>When we have one talk, it's about 40 minutes. When we have two talks, each one is about 20 minutes. Pick the length that you prefer.</li>
      <li>The topic should mostly be about Front-end development, but can touch on related topics like process and workflow.</li>
      <li>Read and follow our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Head on over to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/">our meetup group</a> to find out when our next event is. See you there!</p>
