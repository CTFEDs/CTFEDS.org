title: Social media sharing buttons
---

The short version: **many case studies have shown that people tend not to use social media sharing buttons**. On top of this, **many implementations are not performant**, resulting in a heavier, slower, page and a worse experience for the user.

## People don't tap / click through on shared links

Less than 1% of a site's page views can come from sharing buttons. Even on mobile devices, where social media is most popular, people are more likely to click on an ad than on a share button.

## People share without reading

If your goal is to get people reading and interacting with your content, sharing buttons may not be the way.

## Share button "Drop-in" code tends to be heavy

The Copy-Pasteable code from Twitter, Facebook, and so on, doesn't always follow modern web development best practices and will load in (relatively) large amounts of CSS and JS, from the providers own servers. More requests mean a heavier, slower, page; relying on 3rd party scripts means adding a dependency on someone's else's code.
